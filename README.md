# Braille
Braille web application

## What is it ?

A Perkins-like simulator with traditional keyboard or touch recognition as input, and text to speach as output.

Live Demo : http://arnaudfabre.github.io/Braille/

## Why ?

Blinds use braille alphabet to write and read texts. A specific braille device is still expensive.
This app lets blind write texts like if they were using a braille device and hear what they type.

No need for expensive braille device, no need to install and configure screen reader. Available everywhere...

## Limitations

Currently, there are a lot of missing functionalities :
- tts only supported from Chrome 33
- only with french alphabet
- no possibility to copy/paste to another app, or to use as a service
- still buggy on ipad, and maybe on other devices

## Other functionalities / requests

- Make a speaking App example for children that ask questions and let the user enter answer with keyboard
- Allow to load/save brf file for embossing

## Next efforts

- better braille font
- Separate Logic / View
- Separate keyboard / Apps
