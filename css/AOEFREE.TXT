            Freeware, and Purchasable Fonts Galore
            (c)1999 by Astigmatic One Eye Foundry
            
            The Freeware Font(s) included in this pack were created by Astigmatic One
            Eye Font Foundry, (aka Brian J. Bonislawsky - Astigma).  Since November
            5th, 1996, I have been creating fonts and offering them on the web to
            the public.  Since then I have strived to create a full range of fonts,
            from the bizarre to the sometimes nearing traditional, from picture fonts
            to utility fonts, and I will continue to do so for a long time to come. 
            All Astigmatic One Eye Fonts are available in Truetype format for the
            Macintosh and PC compatibles, (Postscript Type 1 can be made available
            upon request).
            
            At last count at the beginning of 1999 I have over 100 fonts available 
            online for viewing, download or purchase, approx. 36 of them are Freeware.
            If you use my Freeware fonts don't forget to check out what's available 
            for purchase, after all, without your support I will be unable to the 
            time to offer you my free fonts almost every month.  Any $10 or more 
            font purchase will get the full version of that particular font in 
            whatever format best suits your needs, (Postscript, or TrueType), and 
            also a full copy of one of my bonus fonts collection, some of my 
            freeware fonts, and trial versions of some of my latest releases.  Be 
            sure to check out my full variety of fonts, always growing.
